Step to start the app:

1. Run `yarn start` or `npm run start`
2. Go to locahost:3000

I try to use TailWindcss but it's different to react native in rendering JSX code so I just can create a grid as a map and handle click event on it.
About pop up tooltip and zoom in-out by scroll I think I need more time for researching about that.
